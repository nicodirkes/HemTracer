# HemTracer

A Python package providing convenient CFD post-processing functions for Lagrangian hemolysis estimation.

## Installation

The project has been tested on macOS for `Python 3.12.0` with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. 

If you want, you can create a virtual environment from the home folder of this repository
```shell
python3 -m venv env
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This creates a virtual environment folder `env` that will contain all required packages, ensuring consistent conditions.

Installation of this package works from this directory with `pip` as follows:
```shell
python3 -m pip install .
```
If you have created a virtual environment before installation, make sure it is activated whenever you want to use `hemtracer`.
