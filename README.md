# HemTracer

A Python package providing convenient CFD post-processing functions for Lagrangian hemolysis estimation.

## Installation

The project has been tested on macOS for `Python 3.12.0` with the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. 

It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
This creates a virtual environment folder `venv` that will contain all required packages, ensuring consistent conditions.

Installation of this package works from this directory with `pip` as follows:
```shell
python3 -m pip install .
```
