API documentation
=====================

We provide two sets of API documentation. The :ref:`user documentation <user doc>` focuses only on the most relevant classes for most applications. It is meant to be used as a resource while using the package. The :ref:`developer documentation <developer doc>` contains documentation of all classes and functions in the package, even private members. It is meant to be used as a resource while developing and extending the package.
