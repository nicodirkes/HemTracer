  abstract = {The nonphysiological mechanical shear stress in blood-contacting medical devices is one major factor to device-induced blood damage. Animal blood is often used to test device-induced blood damage potential of these devices due to its easy accessibility and low cost. However, the differences in shear-induced blood damage between animals and human have not been well characterized. The purpose of this study was to investigate shear-induced hemolysis of human and three commonly used preclinical evaluation animal species (ovine, porcine, and bovine) under shear conditions encountered in blood-contacting medical devices. Shear-induced hemolysis experiments were conducted using two single-pass blood-shearing devices. Driven by an externally pressurized reservoir, blood single-passes through a small annular gap in the shearing devices where the blood was exposed to a uniform high shear stress. Shear-induced hemolysis at different conditions of exposure time (0.04 to 1.5 s) and shear stress (25 to 320 Pa) was quantified for ovine, porcine, bovine, and human blood, respectively. Within these ranges of shear stress and exposure time, shear-induced hemolysis was less than 2\% for the four species. The results showed that the ovine blood was more susceptible to shear-induced injury than the bovine, porcine, and human blood. The response of the porcine and bovine blood to shear was similar to the human blood. The dependence of hemolysis on shear stress level and exposure time was found to fit well the power law functional form for the four species. The coefficients of the power law models for the ovine, porcine, bovine, and human blood were derived.},

  abstract = {Abstract: The aim of this study was to determine a method for the numerical estimation of blood damage. Normally, human or animal blood is used for in vitro evaluation of lysis by artificial organs. However, blood has some disadvantages: large biological variability and different initial test conditions lead to nonreproducible test results. For that reason, it would be an advantage to have a numerical method for blood damage estimation. This proposed method is based on the calculation of an integrated hemolysis and platelet lysis index along the path line in the flow field of the artificial organ. The time-dependent shear stress related lysis is based on known experimental data. In order to calibrate these data, the method was first applied to blood circulation in the human body. The results showed that the known data overestimate hemolysis by a factor of approximately 25. Next, the method was applied to a standard Bj{\"o}rk--Shiley valve. The flow through a valve was simulated with the computational fluid dynamics program FLUENT. The calculation of lysis was added into FLUENT and done automatically. The results showed that the Bj{\"o}rk--Shiley valve increased the hemolysis index by 7\% if implanted in the human body circulation.},

  abstract = {With the increasing use of artificial organs, blood damage has been raising ever more clinical concern. Blood trauma is in fact a major complication resulting from the implantation of medical devices and the use of life support apparatuses. Red blood cells damage predictive models furnish critical information on both the design and the evaluation of artificial organs, because their correct usage and implementation are thought to provide clear and rational guidance for the improvement of safety and efficacy. The currently adopted power-law shear-induced haemolysis prediction model lacks sensitivity with respect to the cumulative effect of previously applied stress magnitudes. An alternative model is proposed where a mechanical quantity was defined, able to describe the blood damage sustained by red cells under unsteady stress conditions, taking into account the load history. The proposed formulation predicted the same trend as the available experimental data. The obtained results have to be considered a preliminary validation of the basic hypothesis of this modified red blood cell damage prediction model. To date, the necessity to design further experiments to validate the proposed damage function clashes with the limitations inherent to current systems to get the time-varying shear stress completely under control.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This study explores a quantitative evaluation of blood damage that occurs in a continuous flow left ventricular assist device due to fluid stress. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is used to track the shear stress history of 388 particle streaklines. The accumulation of shear and exposure time is integrated along the streaklines to evaluate the levels of blood trauma. This analysis, which includes viscous and turbulent stresses, provides a statistical estimate of possible damage to cells flowing through the pump. In vitro normalized index of hemolysis values for clinically available ventricular assist devices were compared to our damage indices. This allowed for an order of magnitude comparison between our estimations and experimentally measured hemolysis levels, which resulted in a reasonable correlation. This work ultimately demonstrates that CFD is a convenient and effective approach to analyze the Lagranian behavior of blood in a heart assist device.},
